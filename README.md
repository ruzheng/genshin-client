# Genshin Unit Tracker API

This is the front-end of Genshin Unit-Tracker

This light program allows the user to store their character units from the game Genshin Impact. Each unit contain information regarding to the unit itself such as name, element, rarity, and region. The goal is to allow the user to have an index of character/units they own in the game and in later version allow the user to attach weapon and artifacts(equipments) to each character.
